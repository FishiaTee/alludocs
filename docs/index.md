# Welcome to alludocs!

alludocs is a small project aiming to document various bits of [Allumeria](https://unobtainablemelon.itch.io/allumeria) in order to assist in modding the game!

It is written partially based on information from [one of my GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/FishiaTee/3534267136721f0b01a30692c5cc65ea).

!!! danger "Note"
    This wiki is incomplete, and was written based on limited knowledge of the game's codebase. It is intended to purely assist in modding efforts. Due to the game's nature as an in-development game, things could change unexpectedly.

    Version Alpha 0.7.2 was used in most parts of this wiki as of July 3rd, 2025.

    Contributions are welcome.
